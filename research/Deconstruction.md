# Deconstruction in pattern matching

Our current capabilities for doing pattern matching is not close to other functional languages like scala or even java. And this is because we don't have a way to 
do deconsruction in pattern matching. Deconstructing and matching a complete datastructure is supper helpful when tranversing trees and complex data strucutres.

# Scala

Scala has a very nice feature that allows us to deconstruct a datastructure when doing pattern matching

https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html

And it also allows us to do deconstruction on assignment statements.

# Java


Java with the JEP 405 allows to do deconstruction on Records in swich statements.

# Go



# Rust
